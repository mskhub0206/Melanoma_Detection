## General Information
- The objective is to create a CNN-based model that can effectively identify and detect melanoma, a potentially life-threatening form of cancer. Melanoma contributes to approximately 75% of skin cancer-related fatalities. Developing a solution that can analyze images and notify dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to significantly reduce the manual effort required for diagnosis.
- Skincare dataset has been used for this assignment.


## Conclusions
- Before class imbalance and Augumentation, In terms of accuracy, the model is performing at around 75-80%. This level of accuracy suggests that the model has enough features or information to accurately remember the patterns present in the training data.
- After augumentation, In terms of accuracy, the model is performing at around 75-80%. This level of accuracy suggests that the model has enough features or information to accurately remember the patterns present in the training data.
- After the class imbalance handling, it is evident that there is a increase in the accuracy.
